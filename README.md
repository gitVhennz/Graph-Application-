Introduction:
The Flight Route Manager is a Java-based application that models a flight network using a graph data structure. Airports are represented as nodes, and direct flight routes are represented as edges with distances as weights. This system allows users to manage a network of airports and routes interactively.


Key Features:

Add Airports: Dynamically add airport codes to the flight network.

Add Routes: Create direct flight routes between airports with distances.

Shortest Route Calculation: Find the shortest distance between two airports using Dijkstra's algorithm.

Print All Routes: Display all airports and their connections in the network.

Interactive Interface: Simple, menu-driven system for user interaction.

Why I made this application: 

I made this application, because this application was developed to demonstrate the practical use of graph data structures in solving real-world problems, specifically in transportation and logistics. By simulating a flight network, it highlights the relevance of algorithms like Dijkstra's for finding optimal paths. It also serves as an educational tool for understanding graph theory and algorithmic problem-solving while showcasing how programming concepts can address complex challenges.

How It Contributes to You or the Community: 

The application contributes by providing a hands-on learning experience for students, developers, and anyone interested in algorithm design and data structures. It can be used as a teaching aid for understanding graph-based solutions and as a foundation for more complex systems in logistics or network optimization, benefiting both individual learners and the broader tech community.
